Monster Tamer Platform Fighter Beat Em Up

Food themed monsters called Palatins are getting farmed as cattle to feed the humans living in Gourmandia.
Our main character named Servan is an aspiring top chef that befriends a palatin for the first time. He realizes how intelligent and kind they are but has to keep their
friendship a secret. As an aspiring top chef he continues to perfect the restaurant's new and innovative meals in preparation for a visit from the one of the elites of Gourmandia.
On the day the elites arrive they are greeted with their main dish that is fuming with delicious aromas. And when they open the lid to reveal what it is, Servan's face is shocked
to see that they cooked his Palatin friend! Someone switched the meal they were working on with a new one. Servan is distraught and tries to stop the elite from eating the meal
but gets taken away to the back. As soon as the elite digs into the Palatin friend, they collapse head-first onto the plate. He was poisoned. And the culprit that they blamed was
none other than Servan. Why did they falsely accuse him? Was it because he dared to befriend food? Was it jealousy? Not only did they kill his friend, but they blamed him for
killing another. But Servan couldn't do a thing as we was chained up and tried as a murderer.

Servan gets sent to place for exiles and miscreants called The Grubby Gallows. It's a place for those that defy Gourmandia get imprisoned and fed the blandest of food. But this
is where Servan's story begins as he tries to find out why he was framed and to avenge his Palatin friend.
